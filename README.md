***Project Title:* Mixed Messages**

##***Description*** 
    I am building this project as part of my studies in the Full-Stack Engineer course on Codecademy.
    The aim of this project is to use what I have learned to create an app that randomly generates inspiration messages for the user every time they run the program.

##***Technologies***
    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - JavaScript (ES6)
    - Git
    - GitHub
    - VSCode

##***How to Use***
    You need to install Node.js in order to use this app.

    Navigate to the mixedMessages directory in your Terminal then run the following command: 'node scripts.js'

    View the results in the console.
